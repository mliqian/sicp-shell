# SICP Shell

SICP is the book [Struture and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1) .

The official website is a litter hard to read. So I build this simple project to add some simple style on it.

## How to use

```shell
npm start
```

That's it. As I said, it's a simple project.

Visit it on http://127.0.0.1:3100. You can change the port in `server.js`.
